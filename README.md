# HUB : Hugging Face
## Description
Hugging Face is a powerful platform to create and use trained models, projets and datasets for Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is a great tool for developers and researchers to share their work and collaborate with others. The platform is open-source and free to use.

## Project
On this project, we will use the Hugging Face plateform to demonstrate of powerful it is. We will use the `transformers` library to load a pre-trained model and use it to recognize emotions in text. We will use the `pipeline` class to load the model and use it to predict the emotions in a given text.

## Installation
To install the `transformers` library, you can use the following command:
```bash
pip install transformers
```
